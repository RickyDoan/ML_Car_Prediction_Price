### Main concept:
* Data Collection & Preparation: Utilized a dataset of cars in Australia, which includes comprehensive details about each car. Preprocessed the data by dropping irrelevant columns and reorganizing the data for better analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Performed EDA to understand the distribution and relationships between different features.
* Model Development: Implemented the XGBoost Regression model, known for its high performance in predictive tasks.
* Evaluation: Evaluated the model's accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error, ensuring reliable predictions.
### Tools & Libraries:
* Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizing data trends and patterns
* XGBoost: For building the regression model
### Results:
* The model provides 91% accurate predictions of car prices, helping users make informed decisions when buying or selling vehicles.
